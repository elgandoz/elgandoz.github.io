## Proven Drupal development experience
I have bee working with Drupal for the last 9 years, starting with version 6.
Since then I specialized in the framework, learning how to customize the CMS, developing for both frontend (themes) and backend (modules).
This is still my mainly task currently, using mainly Drupal 8, with the Symfony PHP framework underlying it.

I have worked with government departments adhering to WCAG 2.0 standards and GovCMS projects, as well as private sectors to create logical and innovative solutions to complex problems.

A very short list of websites I realised or mantained:
- https://www.darwinairport.com.au/
- https://www.darwin.nt.gov.au/#
- https://www.agd.sa.gov.au/
- https://www.education.sa.gov.au/
- http://collectionsearch.nma.gov.au/
- https://www.myhealthrecord.gov.au/
- https://donatelife.gov.au/
- https://placesofpride.awm.gov.au/


As someone who takes pride and responsibility for my own personal and professional development, I am continually evaluating and up-skilling to keep up with the challenge of the ever-evolving web development and technologies.


## Experience with Laravel Framework
Very basic experience, having tried the framework few time for some hobby project, but never in an extend way fro professionl purpose


## Experience with Angular JS
I do not have experience with ANgular JS, although I have a good knowledge of ReactJS, Meteor (Blaze) and most recently I'm teaching myself VueJS.
Althought their architecture and syntax is different, they are all Javascript framework, therefore having the same foundation and logic. 
My knowledge in the before mentioned framework is likely to be reusable in mantaining an existing project made in Angular, varying on the level of complexity.


## Maintain CKAN skills
I worked with CKAN in Drupal during the develpment of a tool to create comparison charts between Australian Goverment Department's Annual Reports.
The tool was done in collaboration with the Department of Finance.


## Maintain Python Scripting skills
Very basic knowledge from experience dating backing to school, were I was using Python as introductory programming language. I never worked professionally with it.

I have been working with several mapping integration in different projects, often based in LeafletJS. I am currently working on a mapping tool for the Australian War Memorial, based in Vue and GeoJSON.  


## Have experience with implementing and customising the Drupal Bootstrap Theme
I have worked with Bootstrap since long time, clean or based froma a Drupal theme for a large variety of projects although it has not always been my primary choiche.
